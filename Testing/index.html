        <div>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                Prabodhini, a student club at IIT Dharwad, extends beyond the realms of a typical spirituality club; it is a journey of self-discovery and enlightenment. 
                Convened by enthusiastic students, our club is dedicated to exploring deeper aspects of life and extending a warm invitation to those in search of spiritual understanding.
